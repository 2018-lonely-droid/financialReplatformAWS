## Description

# Financial Re-Platform

Bigbank is a large government agency that oversees financial transactions in your
nations critical banking infrastructure. Our broad jurisdiction includes anti-money
laundering and the overall health of the financial system.
We have an on-premise web application running a financial health application that
we are looking to move into the cloud with AWS. This financial health application is
designed to monitor the banking system by aggregating the financial position of
banks. When this application was first created, it was using a traditional 3 tier
architecture with web, application, and database tiers.
The customer has seen a dramatic increase in adoption of this financial health
application and is looking to re-platform to take advantage of the scalable solutions
that AWS can offer.
Because of the sensitive nature of the data stored in the environment, the customer
has a requirement to leverage encryption on all aspects of the environment, and
mutual TLS where possible.
